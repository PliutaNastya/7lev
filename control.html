												The 7 Levers Foundation Program (AKA Control) is a 6-week, cohort-based experience for established SME owners who are technically brilliant but feel overwhelmed, stuck in the day-to-day, and frustrated that their business isn’t growing as fast as it should.
											</p>
											<p>
												The promise is simple: help you (re)gain control and achieve your first 10% profit win in just six weeks. Each week you’ll watch a strategic video lesson, complete your weekly focus work, and then workshop your business in a small accountability group (Profit Pod) during a facilitator-led cohort call.
											</p>
											<p>
												By clarifying the 7 Levers Framework, capturing and calculating your key numbers, correcting quick wins, and creating new profit drivers, you’ll leave the program not just with your First 10% Win, but with a proven system, measurable results, and the confidence and clarity to keep stacking wins long after the course ends.

												Over six focused weeks, you’ll move from feeling reactive and overwhelmed to leading your business with clarity and control.

													<strong>Week 1:</strong>

											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="line"></span>
												<h3>
													<strong>Week 2:</strong>

												<h3>
													<strong>Week 3:</strong>
													Take Command of Your Revenue

													<strong>Week 4:</strong>

												<h3>
													<strong>Week 6:</strong>
